\section{Change in Hamiltonian General Relativity}

We have the de-Broglie Proca lagrangian 
\eq{
\mc{L} = -\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} - \frac{m^2}{2} A_\mu A^\mu 
}

and the stuckelberg lagrangian
\eq{
\mc{L} = -\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}-\frac{m^2}{2}(A_\mu-\psi_\mu)(A6\mu-\psi^\mu)
}
and we have the gauge transform 
\eq{
A_\mu \to A_\mu - \del_\mu \eps
}
making them equivalent.
