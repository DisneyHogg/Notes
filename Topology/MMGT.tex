\section{Introduction}
These are typset notes based on an undergraduate lecture course given by Clark Barwick at the University of Edinburgh in Autumn 2019. The content is primarily category theoretic, and he structure of the course was such that many important results, such as the Yoneda lemma, were proved only in workshops. I will try to useful combine this material with lecture material into one.
